# COVID-19 Data Exploration

## Overview
This repository contains SQL scripts for exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data. The project leverages various SQL techniques, including joins, CTEs, temp tables, window functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and converting data types. The aim is to derive insights into COVID-19 trends and impacts.

## Skills Used
- Joins
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Temp Tables
- Window Functions
- Aggregate Functions
- Creating Views
- Converting Data Types

## Queries and Analyses
1. **Initial Data Overview:** Retrieve and sort COVID-19 data.
2. **Selecting Key Data:** Extract key data columns for analysis.
3. **Death Rate Analysis:** Calculate death percentage by location.
4. **Infection Rate Analysis:** Determine the percentage of population infected.
5. **Highest Infection Rate:** Identify countries with the highest infection rates.
6. **Highest Death Count per Population:** List countries with the highest death counts.
7. **Continents with Highest Death Count:** Summarize death counts by continent.
8. **Global Numbers:** Aggregate global COVID-19 cases and deaths.
9. **Vaccination Rate Analysis:** Track vaccination progress.
10. **CTE for Vaccination Percentage:** Use CTE to calculate vaccination percentage.
11. **Temp Table for Vaccination Percentage:** Use temp tables for vaccination data.
12. **Creating a View:** Create a view for future visualizations.

## Usage
